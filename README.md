## Solving the MRWA with Simulated Annealing and Quantum Annealing

This is the Source Code for the Journal Letter on Solving the Multi-rate Routing and Wavelength Allocation Problem with Quantum Annealing and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation.

Within the project folder you can find jupyter notebooks for 3 different QUBO formulations. Within this the networks folder contains set of networks and a yaml file use to create the graph of routes for each network. The demand rates used for the results can be found in the DemandSet text file.
