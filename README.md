## Solving the MRWA with Simulated Annealing and Quantum Annealing

This is the Source Code for my MSc Project: Solving the Multi-rate Routing and Wavelength Allocation Problem in 
Optical Networks with Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation and Quantum Annealing.

Within these files you can find jupyter notebooks for 3 different QUBO formulations used in the project, and the set of networks on which they were tested.
The demand rates used for the results presented in my project report can be found in the comments of the Generating Demands section of the Worst Case QUBO file.
